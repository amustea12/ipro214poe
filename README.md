# ipro497

A JavaScript SDK and application for accessing the Igor Gateway API.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes

The IP address of the Gateway is hardcoded into the SDK. Like the [C# SDK](https://bitbucket.org/igordev/igor-gateway-api-c-sdk/src/44f350113609?at=master), it should be configurable from the environment, a file, or at runtime.
